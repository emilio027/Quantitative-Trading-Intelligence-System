## Abstract
We present a reproducible, automation-friendly analytics workflow delivering measurable business value.
Methods emphasize interpretability, robust evaluation, and decision-ready artifacts (dashboards, reports).

## 1. Introduction
Motivation and scope of the project; alignment to business outcomes and operational constraints.

## 2. Data & Methods
- Data ingestion, validation, and transformation (ETL)
- Modeling choices with baselines and ablations where appropriate
- Explainability and uncertainty (when relevant)

## 3. Results
- Core metrics and visuals (see `docs/img/`)
- Error analysis and where the approach fails
- Operational guidance (e.g., thresholds, refresh cadence)

## 4. Limitations & Ethics
Assumptions, potential biases in the data, and safe operating parameters.

## 5. Reproducibility
- `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, CI for lint/tests
- Deterministic seeds and documented data versions

## 6. Next Steps
Roadmap items to productionize or extend the analysis.
